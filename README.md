## Installation

Because of browser restrictions on CORS, it is necessary to serve static files with a server.
For that, the [http-server] (https://github.com/http-party/http-server) was used.
Then, just clone this repository, raise the server in the folder with the index.html file and access the address provided by the http-server in the browser.
